This project is related to the data: Washington, Chicago and NewYorkCity csv files. It tells us descriptive statistics about users travel patterns.  Here we should put more description based on the gender statistics, user type and most popular station information.  This information should be broken down by month and or day.  
 This file describes the python project that analyzes the data on users transportation patterns.  The question we pose are the following:  
What is the most popular month?
What is the most popular day of week?
What is the most popular hour of day?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
